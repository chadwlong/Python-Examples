This file is a placeholder for my decision_trees_submission.py file using Python.

I wrote this code for an assignment in my Artificial Intelligence class for my Master's program at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

To protect against academic integrity violations, I have not posted this code publicly.

Please read the README.md file for a description of this project.

I am happy to provide this code to interviewers and potential employers as an example of my work.

Please email me at cwlong@okstate.edu with your name, company, and reason for request, and I will send this file to you.
